### Abstract

Battery electric vehicles have gained market growth in the United States due to government policies and consumer preferences. 
Government policy can be an incentive to consumers purchasing electric vehicles, but if consumer preference was strong enough would these incentives still be required? 
In the retail market, consumer preferences have shown to be strong enough to not require incentives in "green" products. 
The consumer preferences for “green” retail products could imply that the automotive market may work similarly and that incentives may not be necessary for the purchase of electric vehicles. 
However, the automotive market has higher costs that may dissuade consumers and require incentives for decision making.
