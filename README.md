Battery electric vehicles have gained market growth in the United States due to government policies and consumer preferences. 
Government policy can be an incentive to consumers purchasing electric vehicles, but if consumer preference was strong enough would these incentives still be required? 
In the retail market, consumer preferences have shown to be strong enough to not require incentives in "green" products. 
The consumer preferences for “green” retail products could imply that the automotive market may work similarly and that incentives may not be necessary for the purchase of electric vehicles. 
However, the automotive market has higher costs that may dissuade consumers and require incentives for decision making.  

## Model
### Hypotheses
Consumers and Policy
Consumers are incentivized by state subsidies to purchase battery electric vehicles [1]. Purchase rebates, income tax tax credits, and tax reuctions help combat the overall cost of the vehicle and increase consumer preference for a BEV [2].

If incentives at the state level were taken away, consumer preference would still be strong enough for BEV market share to go unchanged. This assumption is based on the interest in "green" retail products that have an increase in cost to the customer and no government incentive, yet has increased in market share [3].

### Estimating Equation

A multinomial model was chosen as it does not assume normality, linearity or homoscedasticity; instead it only assumes independence between the independent and dependent variables [4].  
Use of an outside share is representative of not purchasing BEV or non-BEV vehicles allowing the model to aggregate the vehicles in terms of both price and all other characteristics [5]. A clearer representation of the the left-hand side of the regression above:<br>

 ## Data
The data on quantity of BEVs per state per year was based on 13 different BEVs from 10 different companies totaling 300 data points from 2018-2020 on all 50 states from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. State subsidies are determined by the policy, some of which are decided by the vehicle msrp and brand [6].

## Results
### Discussion
The estimating equation was shown to explain that most of the variation was generated by the independent variable allowing the model to be trusted and signifcance levels to be considered valuable. After running a Breusch-Pagan Cook-Weisberg test on the regression, the data was seen to be homoskedastic, allowing for more reliability in the results of the regression and less concern on the mean error. In Table 2, statistical significance can be seen in the treatment variables, indicating that their log odds of effecting market share can be explained by their coefficients. The *BEV* negative coefficient implies that if a vehicle is a BEV it would cause a decrease in market share. The *BEVXfedsub2* negative coefficient is explained by the federal subsidies decreasing every year due to Tesla and GM reaching their maximum funding from 200,000 units sold [7]. The *BEVXstatesub2* positive coefficient increases market share for BEVs. This implies that hypothesis *H1* was correct and will not be rejected, in that state subsidies to impact market share of BEVs.

Using coefficient estimates from Table 2 and the left hand side of the estimating equation, the probability of: BEV market share, non-BEV market share and outside share can be found. 
The probability of market share in BEVs and non-BEVs can be seen in Table 3.
Table 4 displays that the only states with any differences between market shares with subsidies and without, were those that established state subsidies in those years.
